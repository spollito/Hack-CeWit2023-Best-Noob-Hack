      <p>Our ride share company connects students of Stony Brook University to make getting to and from campus easier, more convenient, and more eco-friendly. We know that commuting can be a hassle, especially when you're dealing with traffic, parking, and inclement weather. That's why we're dedicated to providing a reliable, affordable, and sustainable transportation option for students.</p>
